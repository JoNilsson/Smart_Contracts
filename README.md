# Smart Contracts Examples
This repository contains a collection of smart contract examples written in the [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/) programming language.  

In 1996 [Nick Szabo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Szabo) first coined the term *“Smart Contract”* in his paper [Smart Contracts: Building Blocks for Digital Free Markets](https://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/rob/Courses/InformationInSpeech/CDROM/Literature/LOTwinterschool2006/szabo.best.vwh.net/smart_contracts_2.html).  
  
    “A smart contract is a set of promises, specified in digital form, 
     including protocols within which the parties perform on these promises.” 
     —Nick Szabo
